## üí° Collaboration Best Practices

### **Communication**
- Use external chat (Discord, Slack, etc.) for communication while coding
- Establish coding conventions before starting
- Decide on file organization together

### **Editing Etiquette**
- **Communicate major changes**: Let others know before making big changes
- **Work on different sections**: Minimize overlapping edits
- **Use comments**: Add code comments to explain your changes
- **Save frequently**: Though auto-save is enabled, manual saves don't hurt

### **Technical Tips**
- **Stable internet**: Ensure good connection for smooth collaboration
- **Browser compatibility**: Works best on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Multiple tabs**: Each user can have multiple tabs of the same document
- **Offline support**: Continue editing offline, changes sync when reconnected

## üéØ Use Cases

### **Pair Programming**
- One person writes code while another reviews in real-time
- Switch driver/navigator roles seamlessly
- Debug together by seeing the same code simultaneously

### **Code Reviews**
- Share documents for real-time code review sessions
- Make suggestions and corrections together
- Discuss implementation approaches live

### **Learning & Teaching**
- Teachers can demonstrate coding concepts in real-time
- Students can follow along and ask questions
- Share solutions to coding exercises

### **Remote Team Development**
- Collaborate on features across different time zones
- Share prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Conduct remote coding interviews

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### **How Real-Time Sync Works**
- **CRDT Technology**: Uses Y.js Conflict-free Replicated Data Types
- **Automatic Merging**: No merge conflicts, all changes are automatically reconciled
- **WebSocket Connection**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Offline Support**: Continue working offline, sync when reconnected

### **Data Flow**
```
User Types ‚Üí Monaco Editor ‚Üí Y.js ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Other Users
```

### **Security & Privacy**
- **Document Permissions**: Only invited users can access documents
- **Secure Invitations**: Time-limited invitation tokens
- **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted securely
- **User Authentication**: Optional login for enhanced security

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**
- **"Disconnected" status**: Check internet connection
- **Changes not syncing**: Refresh the page
- **Can't see other users**: Verify they're on the same document URL

### **Invitation Problems**
- **Invalid invitation**: Link may have expired (7 days)
- **Can't accept**: Ensure you're registered/logged in
- **Not receiving invites**: Check notification bell icon

### **Performance Issues**
- **Slow editing**: Too many users (recommended max: 10)
- **Browser lag**: Try a different browser or close other tabs
- **Large documents**: Performance may degrade with very large files

## üì± Mobile Support
